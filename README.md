Time Warp Operating System
--------------------------

The Time Warp Operating System (TWOS) was a Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES) kernel developed by the Jet Propulsion Lab(JPL), one of NASA's national labs.

TWOS implemented many interesting simulation techiques as Virtual Time, optimistic concurrency with cancellation, etc...

This repository of the TWOS project is provided for research and educational purposes. It is not supported nor is it expected to build or run without some effort.

My ambitious plan is to bring to life Timewarp into a modern Linux cluster.
